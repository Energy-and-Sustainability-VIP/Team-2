1. Clone the repository onto your local machine and create a folder labeled "Your_name's Folder"
2. Make a python file or jupyter notebook in your folder to work on
3. Find the Max, Min, and average value of the dataset for the column meter reading. (print the whole row)
4. Add 2 new columns to the dataframe containing watts and kwh. (Look up kw conversions)
5. Export the dataframe into your folder labeled "AssignmentOne.csv"

## Tasks for assignment 2
1. Download the zip file for Lecture 6 pinned on discord
2. Complete the lecture 6 notes (activity is optional)
3. Upload your completed lecture 5 and 6 notes into your folder with your name added to the end of the file

## Tasks for assignment 3 (Please ask questions about this one, may not be worded well)
Note: You can look for references in week 6 for team 1's drive for their code or in the github repository named "Pyoneers"
1. Pick a building in the Spring_2025_VIP shared drive (Spring_2025_VIP > data_files_new > pv_data, this is the pv generation)
2. Find the corresponding meter in the main_meter folder. (This is the building load)
3. Create a python file named YourName_functions.py and a python notebook named YourName_Analysis.ipynb
4. Combine both csv's into one dataframe and add a new columns: Building load minus the PV generation
5. Create functions within your functions.py file to reference within your notebook (These should be documented with comments such that other people can use them)
6. Find the the max kw occurence of each day within the column containing the building load minus the pv generation and assign the values to a new column in the dataframe
7. Plot the min, max, and mean of the max kw occurences for the building load, pv generation, and the building load minus the pv generation column.
8. Plot The Building load and Building load minus the pv generation column on a line graph over the total period.
